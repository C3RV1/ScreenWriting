INT. CASTLE HALLWAY - DUSK

TAN stands on the side of the hallway, arms crossed. On his side, the SCIENTIST. LILY is crossing the hallway, alone, as she's been kicked out of QUEEN's room.

TAN
Huh, Queen already kicked you out?

SCIENTIST
Tan...

LILY keeps walking past them. TAN keeps walking alongside her, talking, even though she's not looking at him.

TAN
No, because I'm just saying, those were, at most, ten minutes she lasted in there. I expected more.

LILY
No, she just told me to leave...

TAN
Woow.. She's tired quickly of playing with her *brand new toy*.

SCIENTIST
Tan come on...

LILY looks like she's not having any of this, she speeds up. The SCIENTIST  falls behind.

LILY
I'm not her *toy*.

TAN
Oh yeah, dear, handpicked by the Queen herself to be at her side. I guess it was merit.

LILY doesn't respond.

TAN
(beat)
I guess you worked hard for this. You poured your heart and soul to get where you are. I'm *suuuure* you did.

LILY
Leave me alone.

TAN
It's a real talent looking as cute as you do. And Queen and her... *obsession*... with your kind. That was aaaall you.

LILY stops in the middle of the hallway, turning to him.

LILY
(tears on her eyes)
Can't you just leave me alone?! You don't know anything about me.

TAN doesn't leave. He just keeps getting closer. LILY did not expect this, she retrocedes.

TAN
Oh no, I know all about you and your liking. You all come here thinking you're the *center* of the world.
(keeps getting closer)
Well, let me tell you, you're not. You're just a toy. *Her* little toy.

TAN points a finger at LILY, accusingly, threateningly.

TAN
And you are not the first and, **certainly**, won't be the last. You know how long the last one lasted?

LILY
Lasted-?

TAN
Three years. And then, PUF. Gone. Forever.

LILY is now with her back to the wall. She looks scared.

TAN
So don't let it get to your head.

LILY breaks into tears, which she was holding in, and runs off to her room.

SCIENTIST
You just couldn't keep from performing your little drama act.

TAN
Someone has to put them in their place.

SCIENTIST
Don't you think you maybe went a little... overboard?

TAN looks towards where LILY has run off to.

TAN
(beat)
Whatever. I'm tired of their fake humilty.

INT. LILY'S ROOM - DUSK

The door opens suddenly, and LILY runs in and closes the door behind her. She throws herself on the bed and looks at the ceiling.

LILY
Why did she have to pick... *me?*

CUT TO:

EXT. SQUARE IN LAKE (LILY'S TOWN) - DAY

*Earlier that day...*

The square is filled with LILYPADS, all in her best clothes. A stage has been put up for the cerimony. Ten SPECIALLY PRETTY LILYPADS are on the stage, lined up. LILY is among the crowd, next to her mother.

We overhear TWO MIDDLE AGED LILYPADS talking.

LILYPAD #1
Who do you think the Queen's going to pick?

LILYPAD #2
The third one looks specially pretty.

LILYPAD #1
I hope she chooses the fourth one.
(proudly)
She's my niece.

LILYPAD #2
(incredulous)
Is her?

LILYPAD #1
What, is she too pretty to be?

LILYPAD #2
Oh, nono, I did not mean that...
(the conversation fades to the background)

LILY'S MOTHER
Excited Lily? It's not every day that the Queen visits us.

LILY
Yes, mom.

LILY'S MOTHER
You've been really lucky to be able to see her. She just came three years ago, but you were still too young, remember? We were so sorry you missed it!

LILY
Yes, I know, mom.

LILY'S MOTHER
Oh, you'll find her so charming! She's tall, really tall and elegant. Yes, yes she is. Whoever she chooses... Oh, how I'd wish to be her!

LILY
Yes, mom, I know.

LILY's distracted looking out into the lake at the right. She wishes she were somewhere else.

LILY'S MOTHER
(excitedly)
Now, now. Shhhh... It's about to start!

The crowd turns to silence as a trumpets start playing, signaling the arrival of the Queen. A large carruage arrives to the side of the square, and a bunch of GUARDS make a path to the stage.
